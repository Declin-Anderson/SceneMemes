# SceneMemes
Project for CS-328-001 (Website of Scene Memes)

Created by Declin Anderson, Damian Link, and Louie Mattia

A website and app that allows the user to share a meme with other users in there in a local area. The user would be able to make an account and the application would use your GPS location to allow you to share memes with only other users in your area. The post would be anonymous and there would be different chat channels that have different rules on what kind of posts are allowed and which are deemed inappropriate. This program would be aimed at high school to college students as we are aiming for a younger audience to minimize the amount of content that will need to be reviewed and filtered to provide a fun and socially responsible environment. With a younger audience that is at least of high school age we avoid having to censor a lot of the content that could go through our app as well as this target audience has the most experience with memes and have grown up in a culture that cultivates and views them in a positive matter. Also, around this age is when they are either starting to drive or have been driving so, they have the means of transportation as well to take advantage of the location-based meme communities. Our goal is to make an application that provides an environment for people to share their creations or just favorite memes with others in their community.
